It integrates seamlessly with tools and languages such as R, Python, and Jupyter, enabling authors to combine text, code, and visualizations in a single document.\n\n1. Install Quarto on your machine. Go to [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). You will have to restart your machine.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nExtensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). \n:::\n\n## Install extensions\n\nIn order to use **Quarto** with VS Code, we will need to install the extension.\n\n1. Go to the side bar in VS Code and ``Extension`` or `CTRL+X`.\n2. Search for Quarto and install the extension. \n\n![](media/Picture1.png)\n\n# Set up your website\n\n## Set up your main page\n\n1. Go to the **Explorer** window, right click and select `New Folder`\n\n![](media/Picture2.png)\n\n2. Your folder name will be the name of your repository in GitHub (see [StartCodingToday Course](https://miseppi23.github.io/StartCodingToday)). In this case, I will name it **HowToMakeYourGuide**.\n\n3. To start creating your webpage, create a new file **.qmd**. Right click on your newly created folder and select `New file`. Here I will call it **HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd**.\n\n![](media/Picture3.png)\n\n4. Then we will need to create and initialize a .yml file which will contain the website information: the title, the navigation bar panels, and the webpages (.qmd files) that we will set up next. Create a new file and name it **_quarto.yml**\n\n![](media/Picture4.png)\n\n5. Write the following in the **_quarto.yml** file\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n::: {.callout-important}\n**output-dir: docs** lines mean that the files that Quarto will generate for our website will be saved in a folder called **docs**. \nMake sure this line is present in your .yml file as it will be key for publishing your site on GitHub Pages.\n:::\n\n5. Open your .qmd file **HowToMakeYourGuide.qmd**. And use the keyboard shortcut ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``. This shortcut should have been installed along with the Quarto extension and a side window will open with a preview of your website. This will facilitate the build. \n\n![](media/Picture5.png)\n\n:::::: {.callout-note}\nThe **.yml** file can be updated at any time. If you want to add a page, change your title, formatting, etc. We will manage it throughout the website creation.\n:::\n\n## Add another page\n\nIf you want to create another page that will be available in the navigation bar at the top of your website.\n\n1. Create a **New file** and name it according to the content of your second page. In this case: **HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd**\n\n2. You will then need to link it in your **.yml** file.\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd\n        text: Span\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\n3. ```CTRL+SHIFT+K```. You can now see your two pages at the top.\n\n![](media/Picture20.png)\n\n# Build your webpage\n\n## Header section\n\nWe can now build our web page.\n\n1. In the .qmd file, we will first specify the title and author.\n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n---\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe header section in the .qmd file is separated by **---**. Make sure they are present and that the indents are respected.\n:::\n\n2. `CTRL+SHIFT+K` should update your preview\n\n![](media/Picture6.png)\n\n3. You can add as many details as you need: subtitle, date, specify more about the author such as degree, affiliation, etc.\n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\nsubtitle: \"Know How to Generate Interactive Reports\"\ndate: 6 June 2024\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n    degree: PhD\n    orcid: 0000-0002-7018-9270\n    email: miseppi@srk.cl\n    corresponding: true\n    affiliation: \n      - name: SRK Consulting Chile SpA \n        url: https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile\n---\n```\n\n## Styling\n\n4. Then let's specify the format. Quarto has a standardized format that can be customized with a .css file. An SRK format is available [here](styles/srk.css). \n\n5. Create a folder **Styles** in your repository folder and save the **srk.css** file.\n\n6. You can update your header section using the following keywords.\n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\ndate: 6 June 2024\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n    degree: PhD\n    orcid: 0000-0002-7018-9270\n    email: miseppi@srk.cl\n    corresponding: true\n    affiliation: \n      - name: SRK Consulting Chile SpA \n        url: https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles/srk.css\n    echo: false\n    embed-resources: false\njupyter: python3\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: \"Table of content\"\nnumber-sections: true\ntitle-block-banner: true\n---\n```\n\n7. ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``\n\n![](media/Picture7.png)\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nInstead of linking your .css file to each pages, you can also link it to your **.ylm** file as follow:\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n    css: styles/srk.css\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Authoring\n\n### Headings and lists\n\nSix levels of headings are available in Quarto.\n\n```{.python}\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n#### Heading 4\n##### Heading 5\n###### Heading 6\n```\nIt renders as follows: \n\n![](media/Picture10.png)\n\n1. In your .qmd file, below your heading section, enter your section name. For example:\n\n```{.python}\n# Introduction\n\nHTML reports are more and more popular as they allow a quick porfessional  look, to include interactive graphs and maps. \n```\n\n2. CTRL+SHIFT+K. \n\n![](media/Picture8.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIn the heading section:\n\n- **number-sections: true** numbers automatically all headers. If you wish to remove those, change to **false**.\n\n- **toc: true** refers to the table of contents. If you want to remove it, change to **false**.\n:::\n\n3. For lists, you have several options:\n\n\n```{.python}\n- unordered list\n  - subitem 1\n  - subitem 2\n- item 2\n\n1. ordered list\n2. item 2\n```\n\nIt renders as:\n\n![](media/Picture14.png)\n\n### Text formatting\n\nYou can easily format your text using the following:\n\n```{.python}\n*italics*\n\n**bold**\n\n***bold italics***\n\nsuperscript ^2^ / subscript ~2~\n\n~~strikethrough~~\n\n`verbatim code`\n```\n\nThese will display as follows:\n\n![](media/Picture18.png)\n\n### Notes\n\nYou can add notes throughout your site for better comprehension by using **callout**.\n\n1. Write callout in your file. With the Quarto extension, it will propose a list of possibilities. Try and select **callout-note**.\n\n![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}\n\n2. Write your note inside the **:::**\n\n```{.python}\n::: {.callout-note}\nExtensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). \n:::\n```\n\n3. Hit ```CTRL+SHIFT+K```. \n\n![](media/Picture19.png)\n\n### Links and images\n\nThe same syntax can be used for hyperlinks, links, images, or even short video clips.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nWe will then use GitHub Pages to publish our website. \nGitHub does not allow files exceeding 100Mb. Make sure that all files related to your website, including downloadable files, are below the limitation.\n:::\n\n1. For hyperlinks, use the following syntax. It can be used within the text and will act as a hyperlink to the website in question.\n\n```{.python}\nDashboard Power BI is commonly used within SRK ([Dashboard basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards)), it is very useful especially for monitoring projects.\n```\nWill be displayed as:\n\n![](media/Picture11.png)\n\n2. Create a folder in your repository called **media**. This is where you will save all images you want to display on your website.\n\n3. For local images, use the same syntax. You can also choose to leave the caption empty. You can also specify the dimensions of the image using **{}**.\n\n```{.python}\n![](media/Picture1.png)\n```\nIn this case, it will be displayed as:\n\n![](media/Picture12.png)\n\n4. Use the same syntax to display a video. You can also add specifications such as muted, loop, dimensions with **{}**.\n\n```{.python}\n![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}\n``` \n\n### Tables\n\nThe syntax for tables is as follows:\n\n```{.python}\n|Column 1|Column 2|\n|-|-|\n|R1C1|R1C2|\n|R2C1|R2C2|\n```\n\nIt will display as follows:\n\n![](media/Picture16.png)\n\nYou can also specify the dimensions of your table by adding:\n\n```{.python}\n|Column 1|Column 2|\n|-|-|\n|R1C1|R1C2|\n|R2C1|R2C2|\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"[25,60]\"}\n```\n\nThat displays as:\n\n![](media/Picture17.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nAs the building of a table in Quarto can be time-consuming, if you already have a table in **Word** or **Excel** you can copy and paste it in [srkCHAT](https://chat.srk.global/) and ask it to transform it into a markdown format.\n\n![](media/Picture9.png)\n:::\n\n### Include Python cells\n\nIn your reports, you might want to display interactive features. You can include them directly in your **.qmd** file. Enter your script as follows and specify the language, in this case, Python.\n\n![](media/Picture21.png)\n\nIt will render as follows:\n\n```{python}\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = np.random.randn(500)\n\n# Create a histogram\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add trace for the histogram\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=data,\n    name='Sample Data',\n    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))\n))\n\n# Customize layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Histogram using Plotly',\n    xaxis_title='Value',\n    yaxis_title='Frequency',\n    template='plotly_white'\n)\n\n# Show the chart\nfig.show()\n\n```\n\n### Display fenced code block\n\nYou might want to include cells block without running them. In this case, add a **.** before **python**.\n\n![](media/Picture22.png)\n\nAnd it will render as follows:\n\n```{.python}\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = np.random.randn(500)\n\n# Create a histogram\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add trace for the histogram\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=data,\n    name='Sample Data',\n    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))\n))\n\n# Customize layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Histogram using Plotly',\n    xaxis_title='Value',\n    yaxis_title='Frequency',\n    template='plotly_white'\n)\n\n# Show the chart\nfig.show()\n```\n\n# Add your repository to GitHub\n\n1. Open **GitHub Desktop** and go to File > New Repository. Enter the local path to your repository:\n\n![](media/Picture23.png)\n\n2. Uncheck **Keep this code private** and click on **Publish repository** in GitHub Desktop main window.\n\n![](media/Picture24.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIn order to use GitHub Pages to publish your website, your code will have to be public. If you want to restrict access to your website, you can use a paid version of **GitHub Enterprise**.\n:::\n\n3. If you go to the **History** tab, you can change what has been published. You should see all your repository.\n\n![](media/Picture25.png)\n\n4. Now go to your account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), click on your user profile image, repository:\n\n![](media/Picture26.png)\n\n# Publish to GitHub\n\n## Prepare your project for GitHub\n\nNow that you created your pages and that your repository has been published on GitHub, we will deploy your website using **GitHub Pages**.\n\n1. In your terminal enter:\n\n```{.python}\nquarto render\n```\nYou can see it has created a **docs** folder at the root of your repository.\n\n![](media/Picture27.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf you are still visualizing the preview of your website using ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``, you will notice that your terminal is busy. \nIn order to kill the command, click on your terminal and use ``CTRL+C``.\n:::\n\n2. Go to the ``SOURCE CONTROL`` tab on the left sidebar of VS Code. You'll see there are several changes stashed. You will commit them to GitHub.\n\n![](media/Picture28.png)\n\n3. Click on the **+** sign **Stage All Changes** and **COMMIT**. A window **COMMIT_EDITMSG** will open. On the first line, enter a short description of changes. Then save and close the window.\n\n![](media/Picture29.png)\n\n4. Then click on **Sync Changes**. A window will warn you that VS Code is going to push the changes to GitHub, click **OK**.\n\n![](media/Picture30.png)\n\n## GitHub Pages\n\n1. Go to your online repository and click on your newly published one. Then on the top bar go to **Settings**.\n\n![](media/Picture31.png)\n\n2. In **Settings**, click on **Pages** that is located on the left navigation bar.\n\n![](media/Picture32.png)\n\n3. In Pages, specify the branch to **main** and the folder to **/docs**. Then click ``Save``. You should see a blue banner appear *GitHub Pages saved*.\n\n![](media/Picture33.png)\n\n4. Update your page, you should now see a link to your website built as follows: **https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name**. Go to your website.\n\n![](media/Picture34.png)\n\n\n<center><div style=\"font-size: 150%; color:darkorange\"><b>It is done!</b></div></center>\n\n\n![](media/Picture35.png)\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["styles/srk.css"],"number-sections":true,"embed-resources":false,"output-file":"HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"How To Make Your Guide","subtitle":"Know How to Generate Interactive Reports","date":"6 June 2024","author":[{"name":"Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant","degree":"PhD","orcid":"0000-0002-7018-9270","email":"miseppi@srk.cl","corresponding":true,"affiliation":[{"name":"SRK Consulting Chile SpA","url":"https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile"}]}],"jupyter":"python3","toc-title":"Table of content","title-block-banner":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
