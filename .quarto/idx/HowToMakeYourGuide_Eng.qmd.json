It integrates seamlessly with tools and languages such as R, Python, and Jupyter, enabling authors to combine text, code, and visualizations in a single document.\n\n1. Install quarto on your machine. Go to [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nExtensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). \n:::\n\n## Install extensions\n\nIn order to use **Quarto** with VS Code, we will need to install the extension.\n\n1. Go the the side bar in VS Code and ``Extension`` or `CTRL+X`.\n2. Search for Quarto and install the extension. \n\n![](media/Picture1.png)\n\n# Set up your website\n\n## Set up your main page\n\n1. Go to the **Explorer** window, right click and select `New Folder`\n\n![](media/Picture2.png)\n\n2. Your folder name will be the name of your repository in github (see [StartCodingToday Course](https://miseppi23.github.io/StartCodingToday)). In this case, I will name in **HowToMakeYourGuide**.\n\n3. To start creating your webpage. Create a New file **.qmd**. Right click on your newly created folder and select `New file`. Here I will call it **HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd**.\n\n![](media/Picture3.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou can create as many **.qmd** files as pages of your website. You will be able to call them from the .yalm file.\n:::\n\n4. Then we will need create and initialize a .yml file which will contain the website information: the title, the navigation bar panels and the webpages (.qmd files) that we will set up next. Create a New file and name it **_quarto.yml**\n\n\n\n![](media/Picture4.png)\n\n5. Write the following in the **_quarto.yml** file\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\n:::::: {.callout-note}\nThe **.yalm** file can be updated at anytime. If you want to add a page, change your title, formating etc. We will manage it throughout the website creation\n:::\n\n5. Open your .qmd file **HowToMakeYourGuide.qmd**. And use the keyboard shortcut ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``. This shortcut should have been installed along with the quarto extension and a side window will open with a preview of your website. This will facilitate the build. \n\n![](media/Picture5.png)\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nGithub does not allows files exceeding 100Mb. Make sure that all files related to your website, including downloadable files are below the limitation.\n:::\n\n## Add another page\n\nIf you want to create another page that will be available in the navigation abr at the top of your website.\n\n1. Create a **New file** and name it according to the content of your second page. In this case: **HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd**\n\n2. You will then need to link it in your **.yalm** file.\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd\n        text: Span\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n3. ```CTRL+SHIFT+K``. You can now see your two pages at the top.\n\n![](media/Picture20.png)\n\n\n# Build your webpage\n\n## Header section\n\nWe can now build our web page.\n\n1. In the .qmd file, we will first specify the title and author. \n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n---\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe header section in the .qmd file is separated by **---**. Make sure there are present and that the indents are respected.\n:::\n\n2. `CTRL+SHIFT+K` should update your preview\n\n![](media/Picture6.png)\n\n3. You can add as many details as you need: subtitle, date, specify more about the author as degree, affiliation, etc.\n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\nsubtitle: \"Know How to Generate Interactive Reports\"\ndate: 6 June 2024\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n    degree: PhD\n    orcid: 0000-0002-7018-9270\n    email: miseppi@srk.cl\n    corresponding: true\n    affiliation: \n      - name: SRK Consulting Chile SpA \n        url: https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile\n---\n```\n\n## Styling\n\n4. Then let's specify the format. Quarto as a standardized format that can be customized with a .css file. An SRK format is available [here](styles/srk.css). \n\n5. Create a folder **Styles** in your repository folder and save the **srk.css** file\n\n6. You can update your header section using the following keywords. \n\n```{.python}\n---\ntitle: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\ndate: 6 June 2024\nauthor:\n  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant \n    degree: PhD\n    orcid: 0000-0002-7018-9270\n    email: miseppi@srk.cl\n    corresponding: true\n    affiliation: \n      - name: SRK Consulting Chile SpA \n        url: https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles/srk.css\n    echo: false\n    embed-resources: false\njupyter: python3\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: \"Table of content\"\nnumber-sections: true\ntitle-block-banner: true\n---\n```\n\n7. ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``\n\n![](media/Picture7.png)\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nInstead of linking your .css file to each pages, you can also link it to your **.yalm** file as follow:\n\n```{.python}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"How To Make Your Guide\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd\n        text: Eng\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n    css: styles/srk.css\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Authoring\n\n\n### Headings and lists\n\nSix levels of headings are available in Quarto.\n\n```{.python}\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n#### Heading 4\n##### Heading 5\n###### Heading 6\n```\nIt renders as follow: \n\n![](media/Picture10.png)\n\n1. In your .qmd file, below your heading section, enter your section name. For example:\n\n```{.markdown}\n# Introduction\n\nHTML reports are more and more popular as they allow a quick porfessional  look, to include interactive graphs and maps. \n```\n\n2. CTRL+SHIFT+K. \n\n![](media/Picture8.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nIn the heading section:\n\n- **number-sections: true** numbers automatically all headers. If you wish to remove those, change to **false**.\n\n- **toc : true** refers to the table of content. If you want to remove it, change to **false**.\n\n:::\n\n3. For lists, you have several options:\n\n\n```{.python}\n- unordered list\n  - subitem 1\n  - subitem 2\n- item 2\n\n1. ordered list\n2. item 2\n```\n\nIt renders as:\n\n![](media/Picture14.png)\n\n\n### Text formatting\n\nYou can easily format your text using the following:\n\n```{.python}\n*italics*\n\n**bold**\n\n***bold italics***\n\nsuperscript ^2^ / subscript ~2~\n\n~~strikethrough~~\n\n`verbatim code`\n```\n\nthese will display as follow:\n\n![](media/Picture18.png)\n\n### Notes\n\nYou can add notes throughout your site for better comprehension by using **callout**.\n\n1. Write callout in your file. With the Quarto extension it will propose a list of possibilities. Try and select **callout-note**.\n\n![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}\n\n2. Write your note inside the **:::** \n\n```{.python}\n::: {.callout-note}\nExtensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). \n:::\n```\n\n3. Hit ```CTRL+SHIFT+K``. \n\n![](media/Picture19.png)\n\n### Links and images\n\nThe same syntax can be used for hyperlinks, links, images or even short video clip.\n\n1. For hyperlinks use the following syntax. It can be used within the text and will act as an hyperlink to the website in question. \n\n```{.python}\nDashboard Power BI is commonly used within SRK ([Dashboard basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards)), it is very useful especially for monitoring projects.\n```\nwill be displayed as:\n\n![](media/Picture11.png)\n\n2. Create a folder in your repository called **media**. This is where you will save all images you want to display on your website.\n\n3. For local images use the same syntax. You can also choose to leave the caption empty. You can also specify the dimansions of the image using **{} **.\n\n```{.python}\n![](media/Picture1.png)\n```\nin this case will be displayed as:\n\n![](media/Picture12.png)\n\n4. Use the same syntax to display a video. You can also add specifications as muted, loop, dimensions with **{} **.\n\n```{.python}\n![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}\n``` \n\n### Tables\n\nThe syntax for tables is as follow:\n\n```{.python}\n|Column 1|Column 2|\n|-|-|\n|R1C1|R1C2|\n|R2C1|R2C2|\n```\n\nit will display as follow:\n\n![](media/Picture16.png)\n\nyou can also specify the dimmensions of your table by adding:\n\n```{.python}\n|Column 1|Column 2|\n|-|-|\n|R1C1|R1C2|\n|R2C1|R2C2|\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"[25,60]\"}\n```\n\nthat displays as:\n\n![](media/Picture17.png)\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nAs the building of a table in quarto can be time consuming, if you already have a table in **Word** or **Excel** you can copy and paste it in [srkChat](https://chat.srk.global/) and ask it to transform it in a markdown format.\n\n![](media/Picture9.png)\n:::\n\n### Include python cells\n\nIn your reports, you might want to display interactive features, you can include them directly in your **.qmd** file. Enter your scritpt as follow and spcify the language, in this case Python\n\n![](media/Picture21.png)\n\nIt will render as follow:\n\n```{python}\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = np.random.randn(500)\n\n# Create a histogram\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add trace for the histogram\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=data,\n    name='Sample Data',\n    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))\n))\n\n# Customize layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Histogram using Plotly',\n    xaxis_title='Value',\n    yaxis_title='Frequency',\n    template='plotly_white'\n)\n\n# Show the chart\nfig.show()\n\n```\n\n### Display fenced code block\n\nYou might want to include cells block without running them. In this case add a **.** before **python**.\n\n![](media/Picture22.png)\n\nand it will render as follow:\n\n```{.python}\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = np.random.randn(500)\n\n# Create a histogram\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add trace for the histogram\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=data,\n    name='Sample Data',\n    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))\n))\n\n# Customize layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Histogram using Plotly',\n    xaxis_title='Value',\n    yaxis_title='Frequency',\n    template='plotly_white'\n)\n\n# Show the chart\nfig.show()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n# Publish to Github"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["styles/srk.css"],"number-sections":true,"embed-resources":false,"output-file":"HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"How To Make Your Guide","subtitle":"Know How to Generate Interactive Reports","date":"6 June 2024","author":[{"name":"Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant","degree":"PhD","orcid":"0000-0002-7018-9270","email":"miseppi@srk.cl","corresponding":true,"affiliation":[{"name":"SRK Consulting Chile SpA","url":"https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile"}]}],"jupyter":"python3","toc-title":"Table of content","title-block-banner":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
