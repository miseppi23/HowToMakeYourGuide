# Introduction

HTML reports are more and more popular as they allow a quick porfessional  look, to include interactive graphs and maps. 
Dashboard Power BI is commonly used within SRK ([Dashboard basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards)), it is very useful especially for monitoring projects.
But HTML reports have several advantages:

- accessible from any machine (computer, tablets, phone)
- update it as you go, so you are sure the client is always using the last version
- you can include an option to create a pdf, word or powerpoint file as client usely use our figures for their own internal reports

# Set up your environement

## Install quarto

**Quarto** is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system designed to create high-quality documents, reports, presentations, and websites. It integrates seamlessly with tools and languages such as R, Python, and Jupyter, enabling authors to combine text, code, and visualizations in a single document.

1. Install quarto on your machine. Go to [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

::: {.callout-note}
Extensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). 
:::

## Install extensions

In order to use **Quarto** with VS Code, we will need to install the extension.

1. Go the the side bar in VS Code and ``Extension`` or `CTRL+X`.
2. Search for Quarto and install the extension.

# Set up your website

## Set up your main page

1. Go to the **Explorer** window, right click and select `New Folder`

![](media/Picture2.png)

2. Your folder name will be the name of your repository in github (see [StartCodingToday Course](https://miseppi23.github.io/StartCodingToday)). In this case, I will name in **HowToMakeYourGuide**.

3. To start creating your webpage. Create a New file **.qmd**. Right click on your newly created folder and select `New file`. Here I will call it **HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd**.

![](media/Picture3.png)


4. Then we will need create and initialize a .yml file which will contain the website information: the title, the navigation bar panels and the webpages (.qmd files) that we will set up next. Create a New file and name it **_quarto.yml**


![](media/Picture4.png)

5. Write the following in the **_quarto.yml** file

```{.python}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "How To Make Your Guide"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd
        text: Eng

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```
::: {.callout-important}
**output-dir: docs** lines means that the files that quarto will generate for our website will be saved in a folder called **docs**. 
Make sure this line is present in your .yalm file as it will be key for publishing your site on Github Pages.
:::

5. Open your .qmd file **HowToMakeYourGuide.qmd**. And use the keyboard shortcut ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``. This shortcut should have been installed along with the quarto extension and a side window will open with a preview of your website. This will facilitate the build. 

![](media/Picture5.png)

:::::: {.callout-note}
The **.yalm** file can be updated at anytime. If you want to add a page, change your title, formating etc. We will manage it throughout the website creation.
:::


## Add another page

If you want to create another page that will be available in the navigation abr at the top of your website.

1. Create a **New file** and name it according to the content of your second page. In this case: **HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd**

2. You will then need to link it in your **.yalm** file.

```{.python}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "How To Make Your Guide"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd
        text: Eng
      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Span.qmd
        text: Span

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```
3. ```CTRL+SHIFT+K``. You can now see your two pages at the top.

![](media/Picture20.png)


# Build your webpage

## Header section

We can now build our web page.

1. In the .qmd file, we will first specify the title and author. 

```{.python}
---
title: "How To Make Your Guide"
author:
  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant 
---
```

::: {.callout-note}
The header section in the .qmd file is separated by **---**. Make sure there are present and that the indents are respected.
:::

2. `CTRL+SHIFT+K` should update your preview

![](media/Picture6.png)

3. You can add as many details as you need: subtitle, date, specify more about the author as degree, affiliation, etc.

```{.python}
---
title: "How To Make Your Guide"
subtitle: "Know How to Generate Interactive Reports"
date: 6 June 2024
author:
  - name: Marion Iseppi, Senior Consultant 
    degree: PhD
    orcid: 0000-0002-7018-9270

    corresponding: true
    affiliation: 
      - name: SRK Consulting Chile SpA 
        url: https://www.srk.com/es/contactenos/chile
---
```

## Styling

4. Then let's specify the format. Quarto as a standardized format that can be customized with a .css file. An SRK format is available [here](styles/srk.css). 

5. Create a folder **Styles** in your repository folder and save the **srk.css** file

6. You can update your header section using the following keywords. 

```{.python}

    echo: false
    embed-resources: false
jupyter: python3
toc: true
toc-title: "Table of content"
number-sections: true
title-block-banner: true
---
```

7. ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``

![](media/Picture7.png)


::: {.callout-tip}
Instead of linking your .css file to each pages, you can also link it to your **.yalm** file as follow:

```{.python}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "How To Make Your Guide"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: HowToMakeYourGuide_Eng.qmd
        text: Eng

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
    css: styles/srk.css
```

:::

## Authoring


### Headings and lists

Six levels of headings are available in Quarto.

```{.python}
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
It renders as follow: 

![](media/Picture10.png)

1. In your .qmd file, below your heading section, enter your section name. For example:

```{.markdown}
# Introduction

HTML reports are more and more popular as they allow a quick porfessional  look, to include interactive graphs and maps. 
```

2. CTRL+SHIFT+K. 

![](media/Picture8.png)

::: {.callout-tip}

In the heading section:

- **number-sections: true** numbers automatically all headers. If you wish to remove those, change to **false**.

- **toc : true** refers to the table of content. If you want to remove it, change to **false**.

:::

3. For lists, you have several options:


```{.python}
- unordered list
  - subitem 1
  - subitem 2
- item 2

1. ordered list
2. item 2
```

It renders as:

![](media/Picture14.png)


### Text formatting

You can easily format your text using the following:

```{.python}
*italics*

**bold**

***bold italics***

superscript ^2^ / subscript ~2~

~~strikethrough~~

`verbatim code`
```

these will display as follow:

![](media/Picture18.png)

### Notes

You can add notes throughout your site for better comprehension by using **callout**.

1. Write callout in your file. With the Quarto extension it will propose a list of possibilities. Try and select **callout-note**.

![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}

2. Write your note inside the **:::** 

```{.python}
::: {.callout-note}
Extensive documentation is available [online](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). 
:::
```

3. Hit ```CTRL+SHIFT+K``. 

![](media/Picture19.png)

### Links and images

The same syntax can be used for hyperlinks, links, images or even short video clip.

::: {.callout-important}
We will then use Github Pages to publish our website. 
Github does not allows files exceeding 100Mb. Make sure that all files related to your website, including downloadable files are below the limitation.
:::

1. For hyperlinks use the following syntax. It can be used within the text and will act as an hyperlink to the website in question. 

```{.python}
Dashboard Power BI is commonly used within SRK ([Dashboard basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards)), it is very useful especially for monitoring projects.
```
will be displayed as:

![](media/Picture11.png)

2. Create a folder in your repository called **media**. This is where you will save all images you want to display on your website.

3. For local images use the same syntax. You can also choose to leave the caption empty. You can also specify the dimansions of the image using **{} **.

```{.python}
![](media/Picture1.png)
```
in this case will be displayed as:

![](media/Picture12.png)

4. Use the same syntax to display a video. You can also add specifications as muted, loop, dimensions with **{} **.

```{.python}
![](media/clip1.mp4){loop=true muted=true autoplay=true}
``` 

### Tables

The syntax for tables is as follow:

```{.python}
|Column 1|Column 2|
|-|-|
|R1C1|R1C2|
|R2C1|R2C2|
```

it will display as follow:

![](media/Picture16.png)

you can also specify the dimmensions of your table by adding:

```{.python}
|Column 1|Column 2|
|-|-|
|R1C1|R1C2|
|R2C1|R2C2|
: {tbl-colwidths="[25,60]"}
```

that displays as:

![](media/Picture17.png)


::: {.callout-tip}
As the building of a table in quarto can be time consuming, if you already have a table in **Word** or **Excel** you can copy and paste it in [srkChat](https://chat.srk.global/) and ask it to transform it in a markdown format.

![](media/Picture9.png)
:::

### Include python cells

In your reports, you might want to display interactive features, you can include them directly in your **.qmd** file. Enter your scritpt as follow and spcify the language, in this case Python

![](media/Picture21.png)

It will render as follow:

```{python}
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(500)

# Create a histogram
fig = go.Figure()

# Add trace for the histogram
fig.add_trace(go.Histogram(
    x=data,
    name='Sample Data',
    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))
))

# Customize layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='Histogram using Plotly',
    xaxis_title='Value',
    yaxis_title='Frequency',
    template='plotly_white'
)

# Show the chart
fig.show()

```

### Display fenced code block

You might want to include cells block without running them. In this case add a **.** before **python**.

![](media/Picture22.png)

and it will render as follow:

```{.python}
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(500)

# Create a histogram
fig = go.Figure()

# Add trace for the histogram
fig.add_trace(go.Histogram(
    x=data,
    name='Sample Data',
    marker=dict(color='hotpink', line=dict(width=0.5))
))

# Customize layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='Histogram using Plotly',
    xaxis_title='Value',
    yaxis_title='Frequency',
    template='plotly_white'
)

# Show the chart
fig.show()
```

# Publish to Github

Now that you created your pages, we will publish them using Github.

1. In your terminal enter: 

```{.python}
quarto-render
```
